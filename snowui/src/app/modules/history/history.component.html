    <mat-card-content>
        There is a growing movement in the public and private sectors to reduce carbon footprints. One option to do so is by transitioning to renewable energy, such as solar energy. Since 2010, Alternative Energy Development Group (AEDG) has been developing solutions to make solar energy more accessible to consumers nationwide. Over the past several years, AEDG has speculated loss of potential revenue due to the accumulation of snow on solar panels in various locations. This loss of revenue affects their ability to fully reach their energy generation potential. An increase in revenue would allow them to further develop and expand their operating fund causing a larger business impact.

    <mat-card-content>
        Solar Snow’s project intends to show whether it is financially beneficial to hire a snow removal service or invest in an existing technology, such as tracking solar panels to increase revenue. This will be done by analyzing AEDG’s revenue through the winter months using snow removal at their sites. Solar panel maintenance, even snow removal, can be more complicated than their current maintenance tasks which is important to consider. Solar Snow will use publicly available weather data in conjunction with the sponsor supplied data to perform cost analysis. This analysis plans to show the cost differential between clearing snow from the solar panels versus the current approach, letting the snow naturally melt. The concepts that arise will need to be cost efficient, practical, and solve the problem at hand. The team’s objectives include designing a process to determine solar snow clearing feasibility, considering all customer needs at hand, optimizing our end solution for best results, and adhering to ethical values.
